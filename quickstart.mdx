# Quick Start

Get up and running with vinext in just a few minutes. This guide will walk you through the fastest path to a working vinext application.

<Note>
  vinext is a drop-in replacement for the Next.js CLI. If you have an existing Next.js project, you can migrate it to vinext with minimal changes.
</Note>

## Option 1: Automated Migration (Recommended)

The easiest way to get started is using the Agent Skill that handles migration automatically. It works with Claude Code, OpenCode, Cursor, Codex, and dozens of other AI coding tools.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the Agent Skill">
    Run this command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    npx skills add cloudflare/vinext
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Open Your Next.js Project">
    Open your Next.js project in any supported AI coding tool (Claude Code, OpenCode, Cursor, etc.)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run the Migration">
    Ask the AI:

    ```
    migrate this project to vinext
    ```

    The skill handles compatibility checking, dependency installation, config generation, and dev server startup. It knows what vinext supports and will flag anything that needs manual attention.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Option 2: One-Command Migration

If you prefer to migrate manually, vinext provides a single command that automates the entire process.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install vinext">
    In your existing Next.js project, install vinext:

    ```bash
    npm install vinext
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run vinext init">
    Run the migration command:

    ```bash
    npx vinext init
    ```

    This will:
    - Run compatibility check to scan for issues
    - Install `vite` and `@vitejs/plugin-rsc` (for App Router)
    - Rename CJS config files to avoid ESM conflicts
    - Add `"type": "module"` to `package.json`
    - Add `dev:vinext` and `build:vinext` scripts
    - Generate a minimal `vite.config.ts`

    <Tip>
      The migration is non-destructive. Your existing Next.js setup continues to work alongside vinext.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start the Development Server">
    Start the vinext dev server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev:vinext
    ```

    Your app will be available at `http://localhost:3001` (port 3001 to avoid conflicts with Next.js).

    Your original Next.js setup still works:

    ```bash
    npm run dev  # Still runs Next.js
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Option 3: Manual Setup

For maximum control, you can set up vinext manually in just a few steps.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install vinext">
    ```bash
    npm install vinext
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Update package.json Scripts">
    Replace `next` with `vinext` in your scripts:

    ```json package.json
    {
      "scripts": {
        "dev": "vinext dev",
        "build": "vinext build",
        "start": "vinext start"
      }
    }
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start the Dev Server">
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    vinext auto-detects your `app/` or `pages/` directory, loads `next.config.js`, and configures Vite automatically. No `vite.config.ts` required for basic usage.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Verify Your Setup

Once you've completed any of the above options, verify everything is working:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Development Server
vinext dev
# or
npm run dev
```

```bash Production Build
vinext build
```

```bash Production Server
vinext start
```
</CodeGroup>

You should see your app running with Vite's fast HMR. Try making a change to a component and watch it update instantly!

## Check Compatibility

Before fully migrating, it's a good idea to check your project for compatibility issues:

```bash
vinext check
```

This scans your Next.js app and produces a compatibility report showing:
- Which imports are supported
- Config options that work with vinext
- Libraries that are compatible
- Conventions that are supported

## Deploy to Cloudflare Workers

Once your app is running locally, deploying to Cloudflare Workers is a single command:

```bash
vinext deploy
```

This command:
- Auto-generates configuration files (`vite.config.ts`, `wrangler.jsonc`, `worker/index.ts`)
- Builds your application
- Deploys to Cloudflare Workers
- Handles common migration issues automatically

<Tip>
  Use `vinext deploy --preview` to deploy to a preview environment for testing.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use

If port 3000 is already in use, specify a different port:

```bash
vinext dev --port 3001
```

### Module Not Found Errors

Make sure you have the required peer dependencies installed:

```bash
npm install react@^19.2.0 react-dom@^19.2.0 vite@^7.0.0
```

### Type Errors

If you see TypeScript errors, make sure your `tsconfig.json` includes the correct paths. vinext uses `vite-tsconfig-paths` to resolve path aliases automatically.

### Build Errors with App Router

For App Router projects, you need `@vitejs/plugin-rsc`. If you didn't use `vinext init`, install it manually:

```bash
npm install -D @vitejs/plugin-rsc
```

Then create a `vite.config.ts`:

```ts vite.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import vinext from "vinext";
import rsc from "@vitejs/plugin-rsc";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    vinext(),
    rsc({
      entries: {
        rsc: "virtual:vinext-rsc-entry",
        ssr: "virtual:vinext-app-ssr-entry",
        client: "virtual:vinext-app-browser-entry",
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do I need to remove Next.js dependencies?">
    No! The migration is non-destructive. You can keep Next.js installed and switch between `next` and `vinext` as needed. This makes it easy to test vinext without committing fully.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Will my existing Next.js code work?">
    Most of it, yes! vinext supports ~94% of the Next.js 16 API surface. Run `vinext check` to see what's supported in your specific project.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use TypeScript?">
    Yes! vinext fully supports TypeScript. Your existing `tsconfig.json` and path aliases work automatically.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What about my middleware and API routes?">
    Both are fully supported. `middleware.ts`, `proxy.ts` (Next.js 16), and API routes in both `pages/api/` and `app/` directories work as expected.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I deploy to platforms other than Cloudflare Workers?">
    Currently only Cloudflare Workers is officially supported and tested. Support for other platforms is something we'd like to explore. The `vinext start` command runs a Node.js server for local testing.
